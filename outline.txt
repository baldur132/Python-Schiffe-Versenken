Possible Improvements
 - Using keyboard module to immediately capture keyboard inputs --> better responsiveness
 - Create new class for ships, with subclasses for each type --> prevent god class, better organization
 - Create new class for players, with subclasses for player and computer --> allows expandability, improves readability
 - Make the user interface less confusing/easier and faster to use
 - Change the storage method of the game board to contain legends, as that should be added in the respective print() functions
 - Alter/Remove global functions in favor of implementing the functionality in print() and input capture
 - Merge ai_enemy functions into the players->ai subclasses

Current Issues
 - ship placement is annoying to use, especially with repeated actions/typing
 - in two player mode it's unclear as to which player is currently doing actions (add player label)
 - field placement is clunky, especially as you have to input row and column separately
