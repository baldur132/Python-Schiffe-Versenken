Outline for Battle Ship Game
----------------------------

Current Class Structure
Class Game
  method: 


Possible Improvements
 - Using keyboard module to immediately capture keyboard inputs --> better responsiveness
 - Create new class for ships, with subclasses for each type --> prevent god class, better organization
 - Create new class for players, with subclasses for player and computer --> allows expandability
 - Make the user interface less confusing

Current Issues
 - Ship placement system is borderline unusable without prior knowledge
